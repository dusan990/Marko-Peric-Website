                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Marko Peric an UX UI Designer based in Switzerland. 
                    I come from a very creative background, I had experience as a graphic designer and producer of electronic music. 
                    I worked at the DOS Group and at Pexapark AG in Zurich. Now I'm a freelancer. I studied at SAE Institute from Belgrade as UX UI Designer, now I study in the "Interaction Design Foundation" as UX Designer. I’m always open for opportunities,
                    so feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:hello@markoperic.ch" target="_blank">hello@markoperic.ch</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <h1>UX Techniques</h1>
                <p>My approach varies depending on the needs of the project. Here are some of the methods that I employ in my UX design work.</p>
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>01. Lean UX Strategy</h2>
                    <p>As the first stage if any project, its objective is to have an excellent understanding of the problems we’re facing and a clear strategy for the development of an optimal digital solution.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

                    <h2>02. Information Architecture</h2>
                    <p>With a clear plan in place, we'll map out user journeys and task flows. Linking all user interactions to screens, these diagrams will determine navigation scenarios, choices and outcomes before diving into the design, and lay the foundations for the final product.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>03. User Research</h2>
                    <p>I use qualitative research and quantitative research to build actionable Personas that condense understanding into simple, testable ideas.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>04. Competitive Analysis</h2>
                    <p>I aim to uncover how your product compares with the competition. Is there a gap in their feature sets that you can fill? What are your strengths and failures in conversion, onboarding, retention, and user interface?</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>05. Sketching &amp; Wireframing</h2>
                    <p>I really enjoy the process of sketching out ideas for products – it’s the quickest way to develop concepts and get them to a stage where you can test layout, messaging and screenflow.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>06. Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>I test interactions, messaging and user understanding with everything from a sketched screen-flow to a full-blown pixel-perfect mockup – before anyone needs to write a single line of code.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>07. Usabily testing</h2>
                    <p>Testing your product is key to its success, and we can host testing sessions throughout the design stage to evaluate everything from visual concepts to task flow usability.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>08. Final Touch</h2>
                    <p>The last step of the work is to recheck the whole project again before moving on the developers. Once up to collaborate with the Front-end developers to deliver to them all the necessary for the final planning.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <p>“Marko has created the design of our renewable energy monitoring platform. We are very happy with the results! His enthusiasm and dedication made working with Marko a pleasure. His design ideas are excellent, and his use of state-of-the-art tools such as Zeplin and Invision made it really easy for developers to access and implement his design. I can definitely recommend Marko!”</p>
